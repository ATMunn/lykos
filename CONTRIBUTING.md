If you are reporting an issue, please make sure you are on the latest `master` branch and the issue is not caused by any local modifications you have made.

**Developers:** Please discuss changes that significantly affect gameplay in `##werewolf-ops` before merging them to the `master` branch. They may be merged before a consensus is reached if there's an option to disable them. (Don't add one just for the sake of it if it doesn't make sense to do so.)
