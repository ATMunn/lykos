This is the game bot for ##werewolf on freenode. It's a continutation of
[lycanthrope][1], which has become inactive. We have an active community, and
we'd love for you to join us!

# Running the bot

If you wish to run your own copy of the bot, all you need is Python 3.2 or a
newer version.

Copy `botconfig.py.example` to `botconfig.py` and modify the settings as needed.
If desired, edit `settings/wolfgame.py` to modify game settings.

To start the bot, run `./wolfbot.py`. You can optionally use `--debug` or
`--verbose`.
